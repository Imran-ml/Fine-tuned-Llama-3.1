Introduction
In this project, I explore the fine-tuning of LLaMA 3.1, a powerful open-source large language model, to build a chatbot tailored for mental health support. Leveraging advanced quantization techniques with Unsloth, the model is optimized to run efficiently even on hardware with limited resources. By training the model on a mental health dataset from Hugging Face, it is designed to recognize emotional distress and provide supportive responses. This initiative aims to make cutting-edge AI accessible and impactful in the field of mental health, providing a crucial tool for enhancing emotional well-being.
