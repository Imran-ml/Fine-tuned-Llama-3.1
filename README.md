    <p><strong>We are going to use Unsloth</strong> because it significantly enhances the efficiency of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), particularly LLaMA and Mistral. With Unsloth, we can leverage advanced quantization techniques, such as <strong>4-bit</strong> and <strong>16-bit quantization</strong>, to reduce memory usage and accelerate both training and inference. This enables the deployment of powerful models on hardware with limited resources without compromising performance.</p>

    <p>Additionally, Unsloth's broad compatibility and customization options allow for tailored quantization processes to fit specific product needs. This flexibility, combined with its ability to cut <strong>VRAM usage by up to 60%</strong>, makes Unsloth an essential tool in the AI toolkit. It’s not just about optimizing models; it's about making cutting-edge AI more accessible and efficient for real-world applications.</p>

### **Fine-Tuning Setup:**

- **[Torch 2.1.1 with CUDA 12.1](https://pytorch.org/)** for efficient computation.
- **[Unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth)** to achieve 2X faster training speeds for large language models (LLMs).
- **[H100 NVL GPU](https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/Data-Center/h100/PB-11773-001_v01.pdf)** to handle intensive processing requirements, though less powerful GPUs can also be used.

### **Why LLaMA 3.1?**

**[LLaMA 3.1](https://llama.meta.com/)** is open-source and accessible, offering the flexibility to customize and fine-tune according to specific needs. Thanks to the open-source weights provided by Meta, fine-tuning the model on any problem is straightforward. In this project, we're fine-tuning it on a mental health dataset from **[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Amod/mental_health_counseling_conversations)**.
